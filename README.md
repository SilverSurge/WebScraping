# WebScraping

## Overview
I explore the capabilities of the `Beautiful Soup` library in Python for web scraping.
The main goal is to extract data from the IMDB website, focusing on the top 10 films.
Beautiful Soup provides a convenient way to parse HTML and XML documents, making it an excellent choice for extracting information from websites.
We later also utilize pandas to create a CSV file for the same.

I gather information like title, weekend gross, weeks released, vote count, and rating. I also utilize pandas to create a CSV file for the same. Apart from this data, I also 
scrape out the sources of the movie posters, send a request to the found URLs, and retrieve the posters as well.

## Usage
The installation procedure of [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) can be found in their official documentation.
the `requests`, and `os` modules in Python are also used. One can just run the jupyter notebook to run the program.
